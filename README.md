# EV-Charger
In my project of design and simulation of 2-3 kW Electric Vehicle Charger, I used PFC boost rectifier (AC to DC conversion) and Full-Bridge LLC Resonant Converter (DC to DC conversion) for input supply of single phase 230 V rms and 50 Hz to 240 V DC battery with power ranging betweeen 2-3 kW
